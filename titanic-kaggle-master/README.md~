Kaggle Titanic Data Beginner Machine Learning Competition

My first foray into Kaggle. I primarily used Trevor Stephens' 
  'Getting Started with R' tutorial @ http://trevorstephens.com/post/72916401642/titanic-getting-started-with-r

My final submission was a conditional forest model (cforest_model_1.R). It provided a public score of 0.81340, a score I am satisfied with.
At time of submission, that score afforded a leaderboard position of 395.
I am not planning on continuing with this data set, but maintain this repository as a documentation of my learning process.
